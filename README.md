This is the file which I  will be using to share screenshots of my program and write my self reflection on.

I am running the program from my linux command line directly as it provides better readability than the visual studio code command line

Here is the start:

As can be seen, the program works and an option screen (on command line) is displayed. 
Atempting to list transactions before adding any transactions returns the above message that there is nothing to list as all is empty.
Program does not crash and option screen is displayed again awaiting for user to do the needfull.

Trying to filter when no transactions were added also gives the same result and option screen is displayed again.

Same for summary. Program does not crash when all data are empty.

Here is just to show that the program exits wll even giving a goodbye message. I feel I should get these little details out of the way before diving into the deeper parts.

Here a new transaction of type income has been added. Data is in float type allowing decimals to be entered.

As can be seen, the list module to list the transactions works
Incomes and Expenses are listed separately allowing easy redability

Entering a number outside 5 does not crash the program, user is asked to enter the number again and entering a text does not crash and a slightly different message is sent to the user

Summary also works and provides number of incomes, number of expenses, sum of all incomes, sum of all expenses and provides the amount saved.


Using different data to test if expenses is greater than income:
